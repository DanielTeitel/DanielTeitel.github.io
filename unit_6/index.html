			<h2>The Game</h2>
			<p>Play in April exists to recognise the importance of play for human growth and development. It is one month of the year that takes play very seriously, sort of, by encouraging playfulness across Australia – at home, in the community, at school and at work.</p><br>
			<p>Play in April is here to remind us to play, and to help us play more in everyday life. It is also here to help raise funds for The Global Play Alliance, a group of organisations that help build playgrounds in developing countries with local communities. Headed by Playground Ideas, the Global Play Alliance provides stimulating playgrounds for young children who would otherwise not be able to access the kind of playground that supports important mental, physical and creative development.</p>
